## Installation üîß

Download the source code by cloning it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ARBProtocol/jupgrid
npm install
```

## Usage üöÄ

1. **Initial Setup:** Run Jupgrid for the first time to create the necessary user configuration files:

```bash
    node .
```

This will generate a `.env` file where you will fill in your secure data.

2. **Configuration:** Open the `.env` file in a text editor and input your Phantom wallet Private Key, and the URL to your RPC.

3. **Encryption:** Start Jupgrid with `node .` again. This time you will be prompted to enter a password to locally encrypt your private key and RPC connection.

4. **Start JupGrid!** Start JupGrid a 3rd time with `node .` and this time you will be prompted to enter the password you entered previously. You will then be show the start-up prompts, which allow you to modify the following parameters:

    - Token A:
    - Token B:
    - Infinity Target Value: (Maximum $ value of Token B you want to hold - Dont set this higher than your TokenA+B value!)
    - Spread (% difference from current market price to orders):
    - Stop Loss ($ value for BOTH Token A and Token B - If your wallet hits this value, the script will stop for safety)
    - Delay (This is used to stop you getting rate-limited by Jupiter API. JupGrid is a "slow" bot, and thus doesnt need information every second).

Jupgrid will then place one buy and one sell order based on the parameters you have set.

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

The `.env` file will need to contain your Phantom Wallet Private Key and URL to your RPC connection. Ensure you fill it out before running the bot for the second time:

-   `RPC_URL`=YourRPCURLHere
-   `PRIVATE_KEY`=YourPrivateKeyHere

Once these are encrypted, they are no longer human-readable. Please ensure you have other copies of this information saved elsewhere.

There will also be a `userSettings.json` file created. This will contain data on the parameters you set during setup.
